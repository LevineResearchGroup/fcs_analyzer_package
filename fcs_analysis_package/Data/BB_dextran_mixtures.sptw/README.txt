Dextran Measurements
Bryan Bogin

Purpose: 
1. To determine if FCS can recover pre-determined ratios of 2-distributions.
2. To determine if 30s measurements capture the broadness of a distribution.

Day 1: 10/14/21 T=22 C
Day 2: 10/15/21 T=21 C
Day 3: 10/20/21 T=21 C

A = 4K Dextran, FITC (0.4% labelled, 4/15 FITC/dextran labelled)
B = 40K Dextran, FITC (1% labelled, ~2 FITC/dextran)
C = Fluorescin Na+
Calibration = Rho110 for each day.

Only blue laser was used during measurement.

Solution conditions were Tris, pH = 8.5.

Normalized concentrations based on label concentration.
